# Overview:

## Purpose
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we are providing W. Avy additional information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

To provide the appropriate analysis we filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. Then we converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.
